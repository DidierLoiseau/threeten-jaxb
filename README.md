JAXB adapters for Java 8 Date and Time API (JSR-310) types
---------

New Date and Time API introduced in Java 8 (aka JSR-310) is a big step forward comparing to what were available before in the JVM standard library. Sad thing that Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) by default do not speak the new types. This library aimes to address the issues by providing a collection of type adapters to enable use of Java 8 Date and Time API types in JAXB bindings.
